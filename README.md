# Regression Model analysis on cattles

Numerous studies and articles have highlighted the issue of decreasing lactation efficiency in cattle due to inadequate nutrients in their diets. Additionally, many states are struggling to produce the expected amount of milk from their cattle, resulting in the use of chemicals and vaccines to compensate for the issue. This problem arises from the lack of proper analysis of the cattle's lactation cycle and dry periods during milk production.

To address this problem, we collected various datasets and used efficient Regression Models to analyze the lactation period and State-wise milk production efficiency in cattle. This analysis allows us to create a clear understanding of the necessary nutrients required during different lactation periods to achieve optimal output.

The cattle's lactation cycle affects their weight and overall health, with four stages: Early Lactation, Mid-Lactation, Late Lactation, and Dry Period. During Early Lactation, the cattle's body reserves are used for milk production, while the weight remains relatively constant during Mid-Lactation. Late Lactation is a period of body reserve recovery for the next lactation cycle, and the Dry Period is dedicated to rumen rehabilitation.

Analyzing these periods cattle-wise is crucial, as they have varying impacts on the cattle's weight and health based on their nutrient requirements. State-wise analysis is equally important since it provides a trend in cattle's expected milk amount in different climates.

This project aims to address the above-mentioned problems by presenting a clear representation through an efficient Regression model.
